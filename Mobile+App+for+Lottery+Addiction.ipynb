    "\n",
    "Many people start playing the lottery for fun, but for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into addiction. Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending from their savings and loans, they start to accumulate debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft.\n",

    "A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the 6/49 lottery and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "The institute also wants us to consider historical data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. The data set has data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We've developed a few functions for our app that will help the user realize the odds of winning the lottery.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `one_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket\n",
    "- `check_historical_occurrence()` — checks whether a certain combination has occurred in the Canada lottery data set\n",
    "- `multi_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability for any number of of tickets between 1 and 13,983,816\n",
    "- `probability_less_6()` — calculates the probability of having two, three, four or five winning numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "There are a few next steps in store for this project worth considering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coupling the odds of winning with funny and strange phenomenon\n",
    "    - Example: 100 times more likely to get struck by lightning than win the big prize\n",
    "- Condesning certain functions (`one_ticket_probability()`, `check_historical_occurrence()`)\n",
    "- Expanding the `probability_less_6()` function to include the chances of having *at least* two, three, four, or five winning numbers\n",
    "    - Internal Note:\n",
    "    - The number of successful outcomes for having at least four winning numbers is the sum of these three numbers:\n",
    "        - The number of successful outcomes for having four winning numbers exactly\n",
    "        - The number of successful outcomes for having five winning numbers exactly\n",
    "        - The number of successful outcomes for having six winning numbers exactly"
